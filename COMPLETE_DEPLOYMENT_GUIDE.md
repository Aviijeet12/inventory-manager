## âœ… **Verification Checklist:**

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Backend URL responds: `https://your-backend.railway.app/api/products`
- [ ] Frontend connects to backend without CORS errors
- [ ] You can view products in the web app
- [ ] Dashboard shows inventory data

---

## ðŸš¨ **Troubleshooting:**

**If backend fails to start:**
- Check Railway logs in dashboard
- Verify Java 17 is detected
- Ensure `PORT` environment variable is used

**If frontend can't connect:**
- Verify `REACT_APP_API_URL` is set correctly
- Check browser network tab for CORS errors
- Ensure backend URL includes `/api` path

---

## ðŸŽ‰ **Expected Final URLs:**

- **Frontend**: https://your-project.vercel.app
- **Backend**: https://your-project.railway.app
- **API**: https://your-project.railway.app/api/products

**Total Deployment Time**: ~5-10 minutes
