# Alternative Deployment Solution

If the current Vercel configuration continues to have issues, here are alternative approaches:

## Option 1: Deploy Frontend Separately

1. Create a new repository with just the frontend code
2. Deploy that repository directly to Vercel
3. This avoids monorepo complexity

## Option 2: Use Different Platform

Try deploying the frontend to:
- **Netlify** (often handles React apps better)
- **Surge.sh** (simple static hosting)
- **Vercel with different configuration**

## Option 3: Fix Current Setup

The issue appears to be that Vercel is not properly building from the frontend subdirectory. Our latest configuration should fix this.

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Backend: https://inventory-manager-backend-zofj.onrender.com/api (working)
- ‚ùå Frontend: Still having deployment issues
- üîß Latest fix: Simplified Vercel config with @vercel/static-build

## Next Steps

1. Wait for latest deployment (commit 3648bc5)
2. If still not working, try Option 1 (separate frontend repo)
3. Test with Netlify as backup option
