# 🚀 Pre-Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Frontend Ready for Vercel

- [x] Environment variables configured (`.env.example`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`)
- [x] API URL uses environment variable instead of hardcoded localhost
- [x] Build process tested and working
- [x] `vercel.json` configuration created
- [x] Package.json includes homepage field
- [x] React app builds successfully with production settings

## ✅ Backend Ready for Deployment

- [x] CORS configured to accept all origins (good for deployment)
- [x] Production properties file created (`application-prod.properties`)
- [x] Port configuration uses environment variable (`${PORT:8080}`)
- [x] Maven build working

## ⚠️ Deployment Strategy Required

This is a **full-stack application** that requires **two separate deployments**:

### 1. Backend Deployment (Choose One):
- **Railway** (Recommended) - Automatic Spring Boot detection
- **Render** - Free tier available
- **Heroku** - Popular but requires credit card
- **Railway** - Good for Spring Boot apps

### 2. Frontend Deployment:
- **Vercel** (Ready to deploy!)

## 🔧 Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Push to GitHub** (ready!)
2. **Deploy Backend First**:
   - Choose a backend hosting service
   - Deploy the Spring Boot app
   - Note the deployed URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)

3. **Deploy Frontend**:
   - Create Vercel project from GitHub repo
   - Set root directory to `frontend`
   - Add environment variable: `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com/api`
   - Deploy!

## 📋 Environment Variables for Vercel

In Vercel dashboard, add this environment variable:
- **Name**: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
- **Value**: `https://your-deployed-backend-url.com/api`

## ⚡ Quick Deploy Commands

```bash
# Test build locally first
cd frontend
npm run build

# Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "feat: prepare for deployment with environment config"
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- ✅ Frontend builds without errors
- ✅ Backend starts without errors  
- ✅ API endpoints accessible
- ✅ CORS configured properly
- ✅ Environment variables working
- ✅ Ready for GitHub push

**Status: 🟢 READY TO DEPLOY!**
